This repos contains the comparison between numbers of classifiers such as logistic regression, bernoulli NB and ANN with Python. Also this project contains various of NLP and EDA.
One of the goal of this project is to compare machine learning classifiers vs. deep learning classifier for better accuracy on text data.


## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * Libraries
    * Pandas
    * NumPy
    * Scikit-Learn
    * Matplotlib and Seaborn
    * NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
    * Keras
  * R (For R implementation).
